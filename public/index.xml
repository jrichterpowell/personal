      <description>Doing Tensor Calculus with Autograd Intro to Tensors A lightning overview of differential geometry Smooth Manifolds A smooth manifold $M$ is a topological space endowed with a smooth structure, which is a collection of open sets on $M$ and diffeomorphisms $\varphi : M \to \R^n$ which biject that subset of $M$ to $\R^n$. The picture you should have in your head is that $M$ is locally Euclidean, similar to how the earth is locally flat.</description>

      <description>Estimating Monge Maps Kantorovich relaxes Monge If you look in a modern treatment of optimal transportation, you will likely find the problem defined as something like $$ W_c(\mu,\nu) = \inf_{\pi \in \Pi(\mu,\nu)} \int_{X \times Y} c(x,y) d\pi $$ This is the modern definition of the problem, where we model the objective as finding the minimum cost coupling between $\mu$ and $\nu$. But this is not the original formulation of the problem.</description>

      <description>Prelude In this series I&amp;rsquo;m going to detail some interesting ideas I tried in my research that didn&amp;rsquo;t pan out. By doing so I hope to help other people avoid wasting time on the same things I did. Perhaps they will even realize that something here is not a waste of time and do something cool with it.
Definitions One of my areas of interest is Optimal Transportation. The curious reader can no doubt find a better expose of these ideas on Wikipedia or in one of many books, but the gist is the following: we take some Polish metric space $X$, two probability measures $\mu, \nu \in \mathcal{P}(X)$, and a cost function $c : X \times X \rightarrow \mathbb{R}$.</description>
