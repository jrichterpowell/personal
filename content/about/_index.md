Hi, I'm Jack Richter-Powell. Currently, I'm a PhD student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology under the superivision of [Justin Solomon](http://people.csail.mit.edu/jsolomon). Before that, I was a visiting researcher under the supervision of [David Duvenaud](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~duvenaud/) at the [Vector Institute](https://www.vectorinsitute.ai) from 2022-2023. Concurrently, I worked out of the MILA group headed by Yoshua Bengio for the summer of 2023.

My research involves developing principled and structured learning algorithms with strong inductive biases derived from differential geometry, PDE theory and more recently physics. Put simply: stop learning principles you already know -- save the learning for the hard bits. 

An example of this can be seen in our recently accepted NeurIPS 2022 paper, [Neural Conservation Laws](https://arxiv.org/abs/2210.01741) (along with [Ricky Chen](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rtqichen/) and [Yaron Lipman](https://www.wisdom.weizmann.ac.il/~ylipman/)). A brief synopsis: we exploited the classical identity d^2=0 to parameterize exact solutions of the continuity equation. This allows us to structurally enforce conservation of mass for applications like variable density fluid simulation and dynamical optimal transport.

Before that, I collaborated with [Rustum Choksi](https://www.math.mcgill.ca/rchoksi/) and [Carola Bibiane-Sch√∂nlieb](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/cbs31/Home.html) on a data-driven extension of the [Maximum Entropy on the Mean Method for Image Deblurring / Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10434).
