Hi, I'm Jack Richter-Powell. I've just finished my undergraduate at McGill in Mathematics and Computer Science. I'll be starting a PhD next fall, but I'm not sure where yet. 

Currently,  my research involves applying differentiable programming to problems from Differential Geometry and Optimal Transport. Some baby steps in this direction were detailed in our recent paper "Input Convex Gradient Networks", but this is just one of many avenues I hope to explore within this paradigm. We are working on a follow up paper that will hopefully go deeper in this direction.

Concurrently, I am also collaborating with [Rustum Choksi](https://www.math.mcgill.ca/rchoksi/) and [Carola Bibiane-Sch√∂nlieb](https://www.damtp.cam.ac.uk/user/cbs31/Home.html) on expanding the [Maximum Entropy on the Mean Method for Image Deblurring / Denoising](https://arxiv.org/abs/2002.10434). We have developed a new method that allows us to incorporate high level features from a dataset into a prior distribution -- which we refer to as a learned prior. We will be detailing this in a upcoming JMLR submission in early 2022.

Additionally, I am also beginning to work with [Ricky Chen](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~rtqichen/), [Jesse Bettencourt](https://www.jessebett.com/) and [David Duvenaud](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~duvenaud/) on extending their work on Neural ODEs to a class of partial differential equations.
