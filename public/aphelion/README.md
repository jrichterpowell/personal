This is the repository for my minigame Aphelion!
The game is coded in javascript using paperJS for vector graphics, but all the physics / game logic is my own. You can try it [here](https://jrichterpowell.ca/aphelion).

## TODO List
- Add customizable physics constants
- Implement black holes / quasars
- Fix restarts
